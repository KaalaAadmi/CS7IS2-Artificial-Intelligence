# Metrics to judge performance:

- Time taken to find a solution: This is the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to find a solution from the starting point to the destination point in the maze.

- Number of nodes expanded: This is the number of nodes visited or expanded by the algorithm while searching for a solution. A node represents a point in the maze that the algorithm has visited.

- Memory consumption: This is the amount of memory used by the algorithm to store the maze and the search tree or queue.

- Optimality of the solution found: This is the quality of the solution found by the algorithm, such as the length of the path or the number of steps taken.

- Scalability: This is the ability of the algorithm to handle mazes of increasing size or complexity.

- *Robustness: This is the ability of the algorithm to handle different types of mazes, such as mazes with multiple paths or dead-ends.*

We will evaluate the algorithms based on various criteria, such as the 
time taken to find a solution, 
the memory consumption, 
the number of nodes expanded(for search algorithms only), 
number of steps in path
the optimality of the solution and 
the scalability of the algorithm.

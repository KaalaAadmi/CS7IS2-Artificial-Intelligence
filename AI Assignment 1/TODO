Submission:
  - Zip File:
    - readme.txt:
      - has all commands which is used to run all the algorithms.
    - Performance Analysis.pdf:
      - Compare the performance of all 5 algorithms from points 2 and 3 to each other in a range of mazes of at least 3 different sizes using a range of at least 2 suitable metrics. Analyse and 
        discuss 
        - the comparison between different search algorithms to each other,  - BFS,DFS,A Star
        - comparison between different MDP algorithms to each other,  - value_iteration,policy_iteration
        - comparison between search and MDP algorithms.  - All of the above together
      - including visual comparison/graphs/tables/screenshots as required
      -  code for the functions containing implementations of the 5 algorithms need to be added as the appendices 1-5 to the document
    - Video:
      - running all of the starter and calculator codes explaining them.
